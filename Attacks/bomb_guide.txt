bombs :
> bomb explodes after 2 seconds
> print when collision with a player. who did the bomb collide with?
	> radius of 30 pixels around bomb 
> when bomb is placed, add a 20 second countdown during which a new bomb cannot be placed


pseudo code/python hybrid:

canPlaceBomb = True

def explode():
	make invinsible 30 px square appear centered on bomb

def placeBomb(x,y):
	show bomb sprite at x,y coordinates
	wait 2 seconds
	explode()
	if sprite collides with explosion (invisible square):
		print(player 1/player 2 has collided with a bomb)

if canPlaceBomb:
	if event == attackKey:
		placeBomb(x,y)
		for 20 seconds:
			canPlaceBomb = False
